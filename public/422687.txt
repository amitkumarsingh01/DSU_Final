The image shows a brightly lit ceiling from a low angle.  Three people's heads and upper bodies are visible in the lower part of the frame, partially obscured by shadows.  Only the dark hair of two is clearly seen, the third person's face is mostly in shadow.  A small religious picture is visible on the wall. The overall impression is one of darkness contrasting with a bright ceiling.
