The image shows four South Asian women in a brightly lit hall.  The woman in the center is slightly plump with dark hair and a gold and beige sari; she is wearing a blue lanyard.  To her left is a woman with dark hair wearing a dark blue top.  On her right, another woman in a green sari and glasses is adjusting her ear.  A fourth woman's head and shoulder are visible behind and to the left of the central woman.  The setting appears to be a conference or formal event.
