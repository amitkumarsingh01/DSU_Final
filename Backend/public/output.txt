The image shows a close-up view of a person sitting on the floor.  They are wearing light grey sweatpants and a dark-colored hoodie or jacket.  The fabric of the sweatpants is somewhat textured, and forms a rounded shape around the person's buttocks and thighs. A portion of a shirt with a design can be seen underneath the jacket. The person's hands are visible near the bottom of the frame, and seem to be interacting with something (possibly a computer mouse). There is a cord or cable lying on the floor in front of them.  The background is blurry but suggests a simple interior setting. The overall feel is one of a casual, slightly low-lit scene, possibly captured from a low angle. The image is somewhat out of focus.
